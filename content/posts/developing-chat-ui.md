I recently tasked myself a project to develop the UI for a chat client that will later become a part of the Dailyprog/Hackerchan. As of now, a lot of the technical details are open in the air. I'm not even sure if it will use IRC in the end. The IRC part came from needing to replace the current Kiwi IRC client.

I'm not really a front end guy, but sometimes I can enjoy it. It can be fun to see how far you can go beyond your limits. In the past, I've done front end work that's turned out decent. This time I wanted to add a few steps to my process by introducing wireframing and really polishing up the end product.

# Wireframing with Balsamiq

There were a few different solutions I found. The two most common were Balsamiq and Sketch. I've used the former a few times before, but never really surveyed its entire features. Sketch requires MacOS, which I don't have. I really want to try it out someday due how much praise I've read about it.

Balsamiq is fairly simple to learn. There are some tricks and advanced features like in many products, but I was able to do a lot after watching their tutorial.

# Mockups

The process of creating good design is not something I'm proficient in. It would be a good idea to read text, draw inspiration, and spend an insurmountable time on fonts, spacing, colors, etc. My goal is not to be that kind of designer right now.

For figuring out designs, I rely on quick turnaround on my ideas, and that's easy thanks to all communication going through the Dailyprog IRC.

# A Chronological Progression

The last one involved me actually coding. I wanted to compare the wireframing to what was actually possible.

There's a lot to do, and I'll have to cut out or drastically update an already made mockup depending on how the vision for the chat progresses.
