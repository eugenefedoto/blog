# Suggestion Gathering

I have free reign over the UI. While I'm dealing with other people's suggestions, there are no requirements in place to dissuade anything I come up with. The main thing to consider are the users' interests, including mine. Dailyprog is a platform focused on anonymity, where Dailyprog users are still highly interested in being contacted in private. A throwaway email created specifically for one website is useful but is annoying to maintain on a user's end; and it's a huge disconnect from the site where the user's work is showcased. Other forms of communication, such as IRC, are annoying to use for the regular person. 

With that said, here are the suggestions I've gathered:

(?) -- not sure if good idea

* dailyprog.org/u/$user/talk or dailyprog.org/$user/talk
* No header necessary outside the UI; no navigation; nothing outside UI; focus only on the UI
* No userlist; one-to-one chat between a Dailyprog user and another interested anon or Dailyprog user
* Full width of page Body
* Customizable by user
  * Selection of Themes
  * Font sizes and colors for various components
  * Avatars (?)
* Upload service to various platforms (Lewd.pics, ThePasteBin, etc.)
* Backup chat log (to drive, send to email)
* Show IPs (?)
* Function to auto insert generated-text of interesting parts of the user (e.g., summary of a user's project)

This is a WIP article that I'll come back to, when I get more suggestions. In future articles, I'll focus on individual features.
