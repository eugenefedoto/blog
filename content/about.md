I'm a guy who has spent his entire life in the computer world. From computer camps, programming in VBA and playing Starcraft LAN, to doing fun stuff like reformatting my PC to try out a new Linux flavor during a high school weekend. After graduating from university, I've been floating across different interests in tech. I've enjoyed compilers, front-end, networking, cryptography, back-end, and reverse engineering.

My goals include finding fulfilling work with like-minded people and going beyond my limits.

My hobbies include anime, video games, programming, and learning. 

Check out my [anime list] and ask for any recommendations. My recent favorites include Amanagi SS, March Comes in Like a Lion, Asobi Asobase, and Parasyte.

I used to play Warhammer Online and hardcore raid Rift.
