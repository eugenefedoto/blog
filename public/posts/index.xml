      <description>I recently tasked myself a project to develop the UI for a chat client that will later become a part of the Dailyprog/Hackerchan. As of now, a lot of the technical details are open in the air. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if it will use IRC in the end. The IRC part came from needing to replace the current Kiwi IRC client.
I&amp;rsquo;m not really a front end guy, but sometimes I can enjoy it.</description>

      <description>Setup  Windows 10 x64 FCEUX 2.2.3 Ninja Gaiden 2 for NES Cheat Engine 6.8.1  Prerequisite  Knowledge of scanning simple values. See: Intro Scan Types  The Value Type Before, I only paid attention to the Scan Type, where I said it&amp;rsquo;s always best to leave it at Unknown initial value. No need to know anything about assembly or how bytes are stored. The next step is Value Type, which is important and needs some explanation.</description>

      <description>A Little Background I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in knowing how to hack. It&amp;rsquo;s what got me interested in programming, and it started out with wanting to gain advantages in games. Though now I&amp;rsquo;ve become interested in further improving my knowledge and skills in computer science. With this series of hacking articles, I plan to write about my journey. I want to challenge myself in different areas (writing, programming, thinking, explaining), make this a hobby, and improve my writing skills.</description>
