      <title>Features of a Chat UI (Part 2)</title>

      <description>In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on figuring out the features.
Suggestion Gathering I have free reign over the UI. While I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with other people&amp;rsquo;s suggestions, there are no requirements in place to dissuade anything I come up with. The main thing to consider are the users&amp;rsquo; interests, including mine. Dailyprog is a platform focused on anonymity, where Dailyprog users are still highly interested in being contacted in private. A throwaway email created specifically for one website is useful but is annoying to maintain on a user&amp;rsquo;s end; and it&amp;rsquo;s a huge disconnect from the site where the user&amp;rsquo;s work is showcased.</description>

      <description>I recently tasked myself a project to develop the UI for a chat client that will later become a part of the Dailyprog/Hackerchan. As of now, a lot of the technical details are open in the air. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if it will use IRC in the end. The IRC part came from needing to replace the current Kiwi IRC client.
I&amp;rsquo;m not really a front end guy, but sometimes I can enjoy it.</description>

      <description>Setup  Windows 10 x64 FCEUX 2.2.3 Ninja Gaiden 2 for NES Cheat Engine 6.8.1 x64  Prerequisite  Knowledge of scanning simple values. See: Intro Scan Types  The Value Type Before, I only paid attention to the Scan Type, where I said it&amp;rsquo;s always best to leave it at Unknown initial value. No need to know anything about assembly or how bytes are stored. The next step is Value Type, which is important and needs some explanation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a guy who has spent his entire life in the computer world. From computer camps, programming in VBA and playing Starcraft LAN, to doing fun stuff like reformatting my PC to try out a new Linux flavor during a high school weekend. After graduating from university, I&amp;rsquo;ve been floating across different interests in tech. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed compilers, front-end, networking, cryptography, back-end, and reverse engineering.
My goals include finding fulfilling work with like-minded people and going beyond my limits.</description>

      <description>A Little Background I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in knowing how to hack. It&amp;rsquo;s what got me interested in programming, and it started out with wanting to gain advantages in games. Though now I&amp;rsquo;ve become interested in further improving my knowledge and skills in computer science. With this series of hacking articles, I plan to write about my journey. I want to challenge myself in different areas (writing, programming, thinking, explaining), make this a hobby, and improve my writing skills.</description>
